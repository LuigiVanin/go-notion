# Go Writable 📒

Welcome to my versatile notes application, inspired by the intuitive design of Notion! Crafted with the robustness of Golang, our backend is powered by go-fiber and gorm, ensuring seamless data handling. On the frontend, we've embraced the agility of Vue.js and the swiftness of Vite, delivering a dynamic and efficient user experience. Dive into a world where simplicity meets functionality, enabling you to organize your thoughts effortlessly.
